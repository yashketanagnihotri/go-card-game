Go notes basics

1. Go is a statically typed language, hence types must be declared beforehand
2. Types can be inferred based on initial value or manually set
    a. var x string = "I am a string"
    b. x:="I am a string"
3. The types once declared cannot be changed
4. The basic types in Go are bool, string, var, float64
5. Functions in go use similar syntax as JS and are declared using "func"
    a. func printMessage(var_name var_type) return_type {
        return var_name
    }
6. Every single value that is used in Go has to have it's type defined somewhere
7. Go has 2 types of arrays - slices and arrays
    a. slices are array with a variable size
        i. arr:=[]int{1,2,3}
        ii. arr=append(arr,5);
    b. Arrays are fixed sized data structures
8. Arrays and slices in go can hold only one types of data
9. Loops in Go also uses for-loop in the following 2 ways
    a. for index,value:= range array_name (for each loop)
    b. for i:=0;i<n;i++ (traditional loop)
